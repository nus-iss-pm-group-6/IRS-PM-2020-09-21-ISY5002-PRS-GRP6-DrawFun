## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Since childhood, human beings have developed the ability to use stroke-based sketch drawings to reconstruct the real world they see from their eyes and to express their nonrepresentational inner feelings. Nowadays, with the development of AI technology, the machine could think and act in daily routines like humans to some extent, as well as in sketch drawings.
